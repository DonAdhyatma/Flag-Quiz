# Flag Quiz

Most of the flag quizzes out there are plainly multiple choices or multiple inputted so I decided to make my own page for flag quizzes where it is single inputted (my preference). I am currently editing the dataset and also adding features.
The dataset I used for this project is from [CountryflagsAPI](https://countryflagsapi.netlify.app).
